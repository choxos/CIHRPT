    "justification": "By studying LG, we will first identify additional molecules that also participate in glial cell development and differentiation. Second, we will study how the Notch receptor influences the development and differentiation of these glial cells. Third, we have developed a Drosophila model for episodic ataxia in humans. Using this model, we will study how LG can influence the function of connections between neurons that are important for locomotion.",
