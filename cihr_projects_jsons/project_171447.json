    "justification": "The focus of this grant proposal is to isolate bioactive factors that are released from certain strains of probiotic bacteria and to test their ability to prevent the onset of inflammatory bowel disease in mice that are genetically programmed to be susceptible to developing colitis. Further, we will determine if treating mice with probiotics either during the prenatal period or from birth will decrease their risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease in later life.",
