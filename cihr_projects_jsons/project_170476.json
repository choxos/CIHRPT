    "justification": "Our research involves studies of proteins and peptides, focusing on the protein segments that are physically integrated into the cell membranes. By using a variety of modern laboratory methods and instruments that can be applied to the determination of protein structure, we hope to discover how small variations in the amino acid sequence impact on the ability of the protein to function normally.",
